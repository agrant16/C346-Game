## What is Zombiefied?

Zombiefied is a zombie surival game. Your goal is to survive the zombie infested lands as long as possible. Throughout your journey you will encounter enemies such as hunger, thirst and of course, flesh eating zombies!

### Features
* Day based survival
* Randomized levels and procedurally generated caves
* Food and water pickups to satisify hunger and thirst
* The ability to attack and kill zombies
* Zombie loot drops

### How to Play

Use the Left, Right, Up and Down arrow keys to navigate the playing board. To attack a zombie walk towards and against the enemy until he is dead.
You have three main attributes, Health, Thirst and Hunger. Thirst and Hunger will decrement over time keeping you on the lookout for any food and water drops throughout the world to replenish these attributes.
If Hunger or Thirst reaches 0 then your Health will slowly start to decrement until you find the appropriate resource.
