### Tasks and Estimations

This document covers our estimations of effort for various tasks involved with our project. It should be considered a living document. As we begin to work on things we'll begin adding in which team members have worked on various tasks. We are also using a [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/2Ki7x1em/c346-project) for task management.
