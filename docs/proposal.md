Our plan is to create a 2D roguelike game using the Unity3D Game Engine and C#. Right now we are working on ideas for our game's setting. We might do a traditional dungeon crawler roguelike, or a more survival based zombie apocalypse type game. The game will feature a basic leveling system where the player can earn experience by defeating various enemies. Also it may be possible to find weapon and armor upgrades as the player progesses in levels. 

### Possible Game Features

* Procedurally Generated Overland Levels
* Procedurally Generated Cave Levels
* Player Leveling System
* Combat System
* Ability to Save Current Progress
* Multiple Enemies
* Weapon and Armor Upgrades
* Multiple Player Characters
* Multiplayer Support
