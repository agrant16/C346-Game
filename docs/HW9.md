##HW9 Project Update##

Right now we don't have many tests in our code. We've been researching unit testing in Unity and we've found several testing frameworks both free and non-free. In our research we've found that many people find it easier and better to take whatever logic they can out of Unity for testing. Most of what we've seen recommends putting your logic in a Visual Studio project and using the NUnit framework to perform unit tests of the logic.

Right now we've created a subdirectory for our testing code. Our plan is to rearrange some of our logic and make it easier to test over Spring Break. Once this is done it will be easier to implement more tests.
